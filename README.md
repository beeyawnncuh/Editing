## Editing, what is it?

Editing can be a many number of things, whether you're changing the lighting of a photo or adding transitions to a video, these are both common forms of editing. Many people believe editing is only done for projects to make their presentation look more presentable. However, since editing is such a broad term for so many different actions it opens up a whole other world possibilities and experiences. So, I am going to shine light upon my own experience with editing.

### What does editing mean to me

I've been doing video editing of different pictures and clips to create what we call "fan edits". Although many would probably say this is a cringey hobby, I find a lot of joy in doing it. I've been video editing since 7th grade, and I often get to look back on old edits I've done to see how much I've improved. I have had a total of three different editing accounts on Instagram since 7th, and I'm currently active on the 3rd account. Editing has been an outlet for creativity for me and a way to meet people with the same hobby.
