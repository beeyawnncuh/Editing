## Editing, what is it?

Editing can be a many number of things, whether you're changing the lighting of a photo or adding transitions to a video, these are both common forms of editing. Many people believe editing is only done for projects to make their presentation look more presentable. However, since editing is such a broad term for so many different actions it opens up a whole other world possibilities and experiences. So, I am going to shine light upon my own experience with editing.

### What does editing mean to me

I've been doing video editing of different pictures and clips to create what we call "fan edits". Although many would probably say this is a cringey hobby, I find a lot of joy in doing it. I've been video editing since 7th grade, and I often get to look back on old edits I've done to see how much I've improved. I have had a total of three different editing accounts on Instagram since 7th, and I'm currently active on the 3rd account. Editing has been an outlet for creativity for me and a way to meet people with the same hobby. 

### Videostar

I have tried many different programs/ apps, from vivavideo (yes, not the peak of my editing career thats for sure), cutecut, alight motion, after effects, and videostar. The current app I use is videostar, since I find it to be very convenient since it allows me to make many edits with just my phone. Videostar is actually a pretty well known app in the fan editing community, and there are many options available in the app to enhance your editing experience. For example, you're able to view your current and previous projects with different "windows"

**Another feature Videostar provides is how long you've spent editing that project. If you click on the small "i" icon at the bottom right of the project a window will pop up telling you information about that specific project.**

If you want to know more about Videostar and the editing features they have you can check out their [Instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/videostarapp/?hl=en)

To be honest, if I knew how to attach videos to websites I would try to include one of my edits but as you can probably tell I am very bad at coding, my apologies.

### Conclusion
Editing is a very big part of my life as it serves as a coping mechanism and kind of the only talent I have if I'm being completely honest. But if you're ever looking for a hobby that could quite possibly be long term, editing is the way to go! It can be with photoshopping pictures, creating short films, or fan edits just like me :)
